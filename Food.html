               TEXT: LUKE 8:16-25 <br>
            TOPIC: BE IN HIM, OBEY HIM AND HE WILL SEE YOU THROUGH THE STORM</h4>

            The whole essence of the parable of the lamp is to stress the obvious truth that those who really have the light would shine it out. <br>

However, many were claiming they had the light with out any visible evidence of it. Such people would not only continue in darkness but suffer even greater darkness. 

This applies to people who are very religious but live in sin and refuse the gospel message because they believe they know enough about God. 

For those of us who truly know the Lord, our spiritual ties in Christ are stronger than natural ties.

Indeed, in heaven, there would no natural but only spiritual ties. And when we obey the Lord, we should have faith that, just as He was with the disciples through the storm, He would be with us and see us through any storms of life, once we call upon Him.
