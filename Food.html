               TEXT: LUKE 19: 13 <br>
               TOPIC: REVIEWING THE YEAR OF OCCUPYING</h4>

               Last year, the Lord engaged us in His main mandate and the reason for our being on earth.

               We learned certain key things about the fact that the Lord has an on-going project into which we have all been engaged as believers. 
               
               We have all been given minas (money, resources, and so on) to be used in furtherance of God's Kingdom on earth. 
               
               Faithfulness, resourcefulness and prudence are required of us because there will be a day of reckoning.
               
               Unfortunately, while we as believers do want God to entrust us with His minas, we despise accountability. It is not possible to have one without the other. 
               
               These resources for which we are required to account include all material privileges at our disposal.
               The others are immaterial resources such as our gifting and talents. 
               
               The Lord requires us to totality be business people, marketing the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, making converts and disciplining them to maturity. 
               
               The year 2023 is now in the past, but God still requires us to occupy.
